# PhishingReportAddin

Deploying the PhishingRibbon add-in to Outlook involves several steps. Here's a general guide on how to deploy a VSTO (Visual Studio Tools for Office) add-in like yours:

Build the Solution:

In Visual Studio, set the solution configuration to "Release"
Build the solution (Build > Build Solution)


Create a deployment package:

Right-click on your project in Solution Explorer
Select "Publish"
Choose a publish method (e.g., File System, FTP, Web Site)
Set a location for the published files
Click "Publish"


Distribute the files:

The publish process will create a setup.exe file and a .vsto file
These files, along with any other dependencies, need to be distributed to users


Installation on user machines:

Users run the setup.exe file to install the add-in
Outlook must be closed during installation


Group Policy Deployment (for organizations):

Create a network share with the installation files
Use Group Policy to deploy the add-in across the organization


ClickOnce Deployment:

This allows users to install from a web server and receive automatic updates
Publish to a web server
Users navigate to the .vsto file URL to install


Manage Trust:

Ensure the add-in is signed with a trusted certificate
Configure Outlook's Trust Center settings to allow the add-in


Centralized Deployment (for Microsoft 365):

Use the Microsoft 365 Admin Center to deploy add-ins centrally



For your specific add-in:

Ensure all necessary files are included in the deployment package
Update the security email address from the demo address to the actual one
Test the deployment in a controlled environment before wide distribution

Remember, the exact steps might vary depending on your organization's IT policies and infrastructure. Always consult with your IT department for the best deployment strategy in your specific environment.
